XkeysRptParser - A project to read Xkeys HID reports on an Arduino and
generate events when a key is pressed.  Just sub class the
XkeysReportParser class and implement the OnKeyUp or OnKeyDown methods
to receive the reports.  This class requires the following Arduino
library:

Download the project files and place them in your Arduino libraries
folder.

I have created a basic example sketch that you can load and test from
the Examples menu item in the Arduino editor.

More documentation to come soon.
